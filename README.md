# jQuery Content Tools

## What does it do and what is it good for?

The jQuery Content Tools Extension is planed to become a Framework for many different Content Element Tools, like jQuery UI Elements, Slideshows and much more.

## How to use it

Clone/download this archive into your project

	git clone git@github.com:andyhausmann/jqct.git

Move the package contents (jqct/) to TYPO3's Extension directory: typo3conf/ext/ and install the Extension through the Extension Manager.

Currently there is no documentation available, but i promise: i'll write one sonn. In the meanwhile you should check jqct/Configuration/TypoScript/ to get a clue about the available options.
Include the Static Extension Template and check the Extension.
